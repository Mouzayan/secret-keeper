## SecretKeeper 🤫

**SecretKeeper Smart Contract**

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that allows any two parties to store and later reveal a mutually agreed-upon secret on-chain. This contract can be used as a proof that both parties agreed on something at a specific block, and it allows either party to reveal the secret at a later time.

**Contract Functionality**

	•	Storing a Secret:
	•	The contract enables any two parties to agree and sign off on a secret. Both parties must provide their digital signatures to confirm their agreement, allowing the secret to be securely stored on-chain.
	•	The secret is stored in a hashed format, ensuring that its value remains hidden from observers and cannot be deduced directly from on-chain data.
	•	Revealing the Secret:
	•	At any future block after storing the secret, either of the two parties can reveal its actual value on-chain.
	•	Upon revelation, the contract emits an event specifying the revealing party and the real value of the secret. The original stored secret is then deleted from the contract’s storage.
	•	Single Transaction Registration:
	•	The secret must be registered in a single transaction, ensuring that both parties’ signatures and the secret itself are stored in the same block. Thus the agreement is atomic and timestamped at the block level.

**Implementation Details**

	•	Signature Validation:
	•	The contract uses off-chain signatures to verify the agreement between the two parties. Both parties sign the secret off-chain, and their signatures are validated on-chain when the secret is stored.

This contract can be adapted for various use cases where proof of a mutual agreement is required, with the option to reveal and remove the information at a later date.
